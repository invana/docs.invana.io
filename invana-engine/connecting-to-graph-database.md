# Connecting to Graph Database

Invana Engine needs to connect to the Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin Server's for communicating with the Graph Database. A typical **GREMLIN\_SERVER\_URL** would look like "ws://xx.xx.xx.xx:8182/gremlin" or "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8182/gremlin" ie., either in HTTP or WebSocket protocol.

You can explore docker compose templates from [here](https://github.com/invanalabs/invana-engine/tree/develop/docker-templates) to deploy Invana Analytics Infrastructure with any of Invana supported Graph databases.
