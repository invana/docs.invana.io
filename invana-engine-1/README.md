# Invana Engine

Invana Engine is the core component of the backend of the Platform. It contains the Python SDK to perform CRUD and Query operations on the Graph databases. 

{% hint style="info" %}
In theory any database that supports Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin 3.4.x shall work with Invana Engine. Vertex/Edge Id resolution needs to be fixed to add any new database support. 
{% endhint %}

### Supported Databases

1. JanusGraph
2. Neo4j
